A really old app in 2018 since I was new
to android development and really didn't
understand anything in native Android, I didn't study android well back there and I was Java fanboy

Last time I work on this project was in 2020 and I decide to drop out it
since it depend on Woocommerce admin rest api and it not complete and have a lot of security issues
and it depend on the old Android framework api and designed in java and xml

I have to edit this project and update dependencies today in order to make the app working
